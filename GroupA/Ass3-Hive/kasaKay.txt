open terminal

-> hive
-> create database folder2;    (this is db name)
-> use folder2
-> create table flight(fno int , source varchar(10) , year int ,delay float);

-> alter table flight raname to air_flight;
-> alter table air_flight add columns(dest varchar(10));

-> drop table flight
-> create table flight(fno int , source varchar(10) , year int, delay float)  <Enter>
    row format delimited     <Enter>
    fields terminated by ','    <Enter>
    lines terminated by '\n'    <Enter>

-> insert into flight values(215,"pune" , 2023 , 15.00);
-> insert into flight values(216,"kolkata" , 2024 , 10.00);

-> select * from flight;


Now open a new terminal

-> gedit ipp.txt 

inside that text file :
215,pune,2023,20.00
216,mumbai,2025,10.00
217,kolkata,2024,15.00
218,shegaon,2023,20.00
219,akurdi,2024,10.00



Now open the first terminal

-> load data local inpath "ipp.txt"  <Enter>
    >overwrite into table flight;


-> select * from flight;

-> create table nflight(fno int , dest varchar(10) , year int ,delay float) <Enter>

    lines terminated by '\n'    <Enter>
    stored as textfile;

-> select * from nflight;

-> insert into nflight values(215,"nagpur", 2023);


-> select a.fno,a.source,a.year,a.delay,b.dest  <Enter>
    >from flight a join nflight b  <Enter>
    >on(a.fno=b.fno);


-> create index idx_delay on flight(delay) <Enter>
    > as 'COMPACT' <Enter>
    > with deferred rebuild;

-> alter index idx_delay on flight rebuild;


-> select year, avg(delay) as avg_delay <Enter>
    > from flight <Enter>
    > group by year <Enter>
    > order by year;
